# Roadmap — SimCity SNES PC Port

> **Rewritten 2026-09-28.** The previous version listed Sprint 01 as current and
> a backlog of T007–T016 — tickets from the abandoned reimplementation, several
> of which were archived in T038 and one (T016, multiplayer) which is still
> marked a non-goal in the same file. `aes/kanban.md` is the live tracker; this
> file is the *shape* of the work, not the queue.

## Where the project is

**The migration to static recompilation is done.** T031 closed it. The shipped
binary runs the game's original 65C816 logic through snesrecomp, and 187
functions are compiled ahead of time to native C. What is *not* done is the
game being playable end to end, and the reason is precise and narrow.

### Working

| Area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Recompiled 65816 drives the PPU | `test_deterministic_replay`, `ctest` 1/1 |
| Title screen, city view, HUD, tool palette | frame 400 = ROM title logo; frame 1200 = city |
| Runtime stability | 12 000 frames headless, no watchdog, no `TRAP_BADPB` |
| Game-native graphics and palettes | decoded from the user's ROM at runtime |
| AOT of declared functions | 187 functions; behaviourally identical to 0 AOT, byte for byte |
| Mouse (P2), resolution presets, save states, rewind, turbo, config bar | T041–T054 |
| Headless capture gate | `make test-rom` — proven to fail a black build |

### Broken — the one thing that matters

**T058: the city loads and then zero simulation ticks run.** The view is
correct, the frame loop runs once per frame for 12 000 frames, and the date
stays `1900 JAN`, the population stays 0, and the treasury stays at exactly its
initial value — so it is not a stopped clock, it is a game state that never
leaves its initial values. Random input does not unblock it.

Two hypotheses remain live and they have different owners:

1. **State transition** — the game never receives the confirmation that starts
   the city. `docs/RE_SCENARIO_NAV.md` step 10 (confirm `ENT`) is marked BLOCKED,
   and that step is exactly this transition. Not yet discriminated from (2).
2. **Emulation defect** — the input or the state it needs never arrives, for a
   hardware-modelling reason of the same family as T046/T047/T050/T057.

Discriminating them is the next piece of work, and it decides whether the fix
belongs to this repository or to the snesrecomp host.

## Next

| # | Item | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| 1 | Discriminate T058's two hypotheses | Without it there is no playable game |
| 2 | Gate the clock, not the motion | `make test-rom` proves the picture moves; a frozen city moves 4×/1000 frames, so the gate would pass. The gate must ask whether the date advances |
| 3 | T025 content assertions | Prove the screen is the *right* screen, not just a moving one |
| 4 | Config bar auto-hide (F1) | Requested; the bar covers 21 of 224 rows |
| 5 | snesrecomp: "writes a hardware register → `lle_only`" | T057's root cause, defence in depth. Class size measured at 1 function, already pinned |

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

- ROM hacks and fan translations.
- 3D rendering or a modern-graphics overhaul.
- Mobile ports.
- **Multiplayer.** T016 appears in older revisions of this file as a backlog
  item; it is not planned. Local hotseat is not a goal.

## Archive

T010, T012, T013, T019, T020, T022, T024, T028, T029 and T038-touched tickets
referenced the deleted pre-recompilation `src/gfx` architecture and were archived
in T038. T011, T030 and T033 were re-scoped onto the recompiled game. T026, T027,
T031, T032, T035, T036, T037, T039, T040–T044, T046, T047, T049, T050, T053–T057
are closed. See `aes/kanban.md`.
